# Slideshow: Search in Rotated Arrays

This is an interactive slideshow presentation made with [Animotion](https://animotion.pages.dev/) that aims to educate about **rotated arrays**, finding their **pivot**, and using **binary search** to find target values in them.

It uses [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for JavaScript animations, [Carbon Components](https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/), and [Carbon Icons](https://carbon-icons-svelte.onrender.com/).
